This copy of Mechwarrior (1989) is pre-installed and unlocked. Dosbox has 
already been configured. 

To run, simply click the "mw.bat" file in the top directory. 
Since the game was originally for MS-DOS, an icon file has been provided
in order to set up your own shortcuts, if that's your thing.

To create a shortcut

1. right click mw.bat and click 'create shortcut'

2. on the newly created  "mw.bat - Shortcut" file, right click on THAT and 
click "Properties"

3. Click "Change Icon". A window will pop up saying that "mw.bat has no icons" 
and to choose an icon from somewhere else. you can pick a default icon, or
if you browse to the location of mech.ico, you can pick a mechwarrior-themed
icon. 

That's it! You can move this shortcut around  your system and it should work
for you to launch the game from wherever it's stored.
