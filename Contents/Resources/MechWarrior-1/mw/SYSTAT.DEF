@EDIT    \ETC\EDIT.EXE
  The EDIT module allows you to interactively input, edit and transform
data.
@DATA    \ETC\DATA.EXE
  The DATA module offers a wide range of facilities for creating and   
transforming a SYSTAT data file.  DATA features file handling facilities,
transformation commands, the BASIC programming language, and Lotus, dBASE
and DIF data file import/export. 
@SSORT   \ETC\SSORT.EXE
  The SSORT utility program allows you to quickly sort SYSTAT files in
ascending or descending order by up to 10 key variables.
@MACPC   \ETC\MACPC.EXE
  The MACPC utility program translates binary SYSTAT (.SYS) files between
Macintosh and MS-DOS/PC-DOS machines.
@MACRO   \ETC\MACRO.EXE
  The MACRO module is an application generator. You can program front-ends
to common data manipulation and analysis tasks.
@SYGRAPH \ETC\SYGRAPH.EXE
  The SYGRAPH package can produce a variety of 2- and 3-dimensional 
high-resolution statistical, scientific and business  graphics.
GRAPH produces scatterplots, scatterplot matrices, surface and contour
plots, equation plots, density plots such as histograms, stem-and-leaf
displays, box plots, iconic plots such as blobs or Chernov's faces,
probability plots, quantile plots, and pie and bar charts.
@CLUSTER \ETC\CLUSTER.EXE
  The CLUSTER module offers a variety of cluster analysis methods on 
rectangular or symmetric data matrices.
@CORR    \ETC\CORR.EXE
  The correlation module is for computing symmetric triangular matrices
of correlation and similarity on a dataset.
@FACTOR  \ETC\FACTOR.EXE
  FACTOR produces a principal components analysis with optional rotations
and factor scores.
@GRAPH   \ETC\GRAPH.EXE
  The GRAPH module can produce a variety of character-based statistical
graphics.  GRAPH produces scatterplots, histograms, stem-and-leaf displays,
box plots, probability plots, and quantile plots.
@MDS     \ETC\MDS.EXE
  The MDS module offers nonmetric multidimensional scaling of a similarity
or dissimilarity matrix in 1 to 5 dimensions.
@MGLH    \ETC\MGLH.EXE
  The MGLH procedure can estimate and test any univariate or multivariate
general linear model.  
@NONLIN  \ETC\NONLIN.EXE
  The NONLIN module implements Quasi-Newton and Simplex nonlinear estimation 
of algebraic functions.  Loss functions may be specified for maximum-likelihood
and other methods.
@NPAR    \ETC\NPAR.EXE
  The NPAR module computes various nonparametric statistics for groups
of cases and pairs of variables.
@SERIES  \ETC\SERIES.EXE
  The SERIES module contains methods for analyzing time series.  Three basic
commands implement a wide variety of time series models, including Box-Jenkins
ARIMA, Fourier analysis, and linear and nonlinear filtering.
@STATS   \ETC\STATS.EXE
  The STATS module computes means, standard deviations, skewness, kurtosis,
minima, maxima, sums, ranges, standard error of the mean, and variances
for all numerical variables in a SYSTAT file.
@TABLES  \ETC\TABLES.EXE
  The TABLES module will produce multi-way tables and, optionally, fit them
with a log-linear model.
