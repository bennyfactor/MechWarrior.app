This is a macOS executable of MechWarrior (1989) it is set up and ready to
go with with everything properly configured. Just download this entire 
repository in the upper right corner of the Github interface [(or click this link)](https://github.com/bennyfactor/MechWarrior.app/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). It will show
up as an Application. Drag and drop this in your /Applications folder.

Also, you must install the [latest version of DOSbox](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dosbox/files/dosbox/0.74-3/DOSBox-0.74-3-3.dmg/download) to /Applications as 
well.

To run, simply click the icon like any other app. 
Since the game was originally for MS-DOS, an icon file has been provided
from the [Internet Archive's old Windows 3 icon archive](https://ia802301.us.archive.org/view_archive.php?archive=/2/items/win_icons/win_icons.zip).
Specifically, it is "iconart.dll I05.png", which I'm pretty sure is a
Warhammer, a good fit for this game.

When running the game, it will ask you for an authorization code at
startup. Like every version of this game that you can find on the web,
Just hit enter and the game will start without it.
